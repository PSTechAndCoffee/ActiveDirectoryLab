# Active Directory Lab

<h1>Create Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Guide Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI&t=2874s)

<h2>Description</h2>
I am currently working on setting up a basic home lab environment running Active Directory using Oracle Virtual Box following the intructions above in this Youtube video. Configuring and running this lab will help me to understand how active directory and Windows nextworking works. I have been using Active Directory to access System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Remote Dekstop at my currecnt workplace, but this will be my first time configuring the Active Directory by myself which I am very excited about it. I will update my work here soon!
